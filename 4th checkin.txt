Previously i have implemented invoice management app using local storage .

now i have created an mongodb database and backend files like .env for database intergration
and i have inserted data into my data base instance and set it to public so that it can be used in other systems also.

i have created api's for data 


final:

i have created new api's like 

http://localhost:3000/api/employeeinvoices/:name

http://localhost:3000/api/employeeinvoices/byid/_id

i have created mongodb database and 

i can approve and reject invoices dynamically and can modify the databse using backend

updated all the frontend files to work with backend implementation and connect databse with it.

created seperate but hardcoded data for login ...(CAN FIND IN login.js)
